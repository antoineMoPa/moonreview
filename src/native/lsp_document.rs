//! Putting a pane's file to the language server behind it, on the window's own threads.
//!
//! Deciding what a server is owed about an open buffer - opened when the text lands, changed
//! once the typing has stopped, closed when the last tab on it goes - is not this window's
//! policy, and it lives in [`egui_moon_code_ide::Served`]. What is left here is the part
//! that is: the state hangs off a pane, the calls go through [`crate::backend::Backend`] so a
//! `--remote` session reaches servers on the far machine, and they run on
//! [`crate::native::tasks`] rather than on a thread the crate would otherwise own - this
//! window already has a way to do blocking work and hand the answer back on a later frame,
//! and two of those would be one too many.
//!
//! What the answers are then used for is [`crate::native::definition`]'s business - and a
//! ⌘-click in a review comes back here for a document, because a review holds no buffer and
//! has never told a server anything: opening one for the length of a question is still this
//! module's business, and counting the panes that would be left without it is exactly why.
