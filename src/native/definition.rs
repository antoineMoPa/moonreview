//! ⌘-click a name in a file and land on where it is defined.
//!
//! The language server answers, and only the language server. It has parsed the project and
//! knows which `new` of the forty in the repo this one is, which is a thing no amount of
//! reading lines can work out - so where there is no server behind the file the click says so
//! plainly rather than guessing, and where there is one its answer is taken at its word.
//!
//! A server that has not finished reading the project is asked anyway. rust-analyzer takes the
//! better part of a minute over this repo from cold, and a click that did nothing at all for
//! that minute is a feature nobody would believe in; asking early is safe, because the one
//! refusal such a server gives is retried inside [`moon_lsp`]. What the wait costs is only how
//! an empty answer is allowed to read: from a server that has read the project, nothing means
//! the name is defined nowhere, and from one that has not it means "not yet". Those two arrive
//! as the same empty list and must never read the same - see
//! [`egui_moon_code_ide::AsksAbout`], which is where that distinction is kept.
//!
//! A server's answer is often not in the repo at all. A definition in a Rust project lands in
//! `~/.cargo/registry` or in the standard library about as often as it lands in the work being
//! reviewed, and landing there is the whole point of asking - so the pane opens what the jump
//! landed on, by the absolute path the server named. That is the one kind of file this window
//! may read from outside the repo, and it is readable only because the server named it: see
//! [`crate::lsp::FilesNamedOutsideTheRepo`] for what that costs and what it refuses. Such a
//! file opens read-only, and the pane says so rather than looking like a file of the repo.
//!
//! Several places is a real answer - a trait method and the impls of it - and the first of
//! them is what opens, with a line saying how many there were. The alternative was a list to
//! pick from, and a list is not worth its weight here: a server hands back one place almost
//! every time, orders what it hands back, and names files and lines with no text to read a row
//! by. Landing and reading the tab is faster than reading a list of two.
//!
//! Two places take the click: a file pane, and a row of a review's diff - which is where most
//! of the reading in this window actually happens, so a jump that only worked in the file pane
//! was a feature nobody ever met. Both end in the same question and the same landing. What
//! differs is the document: a file pane's buffer is already open on the server, kept up by
//! [`crate::native::lsp_document`], while a review has never told the server anything, so its
//! click opens the file with what the working tree holds, asks, and hands the document back -
//! through the same reference counting the panes use, so a document a pane is showing is never
//! closed underneath it.
