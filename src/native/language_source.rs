//! The window's answer to the six questions an editor puts to a language server.
//!
//! [`egui_moon_code_ide::LanguageSource`] is a trait rather than a registry precisely
//! because of this window: a review of a repo on another machine has no files here to start a
//! server on, so [`crate::backend::Backend`] carries the same six questions over HTTP and the
//! servers run beside the repo. A local review calls straight through instead. Which of the
//! two is in play is the backend's business and nothing above it can tell.
//!
//! It is built inside a worker closure rather than held anywhere, because that is where a
//! `&dyn Backend` exists and where a call is allowed to block - see
//! [`crate::native::tasks`]. The pieces of the crate this window uses run on the window's own
//! threads, so it drives them itself rather than letting the crate own one.
