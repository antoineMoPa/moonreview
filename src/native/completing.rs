//! The editor draws the list and puts the chosen row into the text; when the question is worth
//! asking at all, and whether an answer that has just landed is still an answer to what is
//! being typed, is [`egui_moon_code_ide::Completing`]'s. Both of those are the same
//! wherever this widget is used, so neither is here any more.
//!
//! What is left is this window's: the state lives on the pane, because two file panes each
//! have their own caret and their own question out about it, and the call goes through
//! [`crate::backend::Backend`] on [`crate::native::tasks`] so a `--remote` session asks the
//! server sitting beside the repo.
