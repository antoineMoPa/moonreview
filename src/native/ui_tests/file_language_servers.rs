//! What a language server behind a file tab adds, tested on files nothing serves.
//!
//! The suite must never start a real language server - a machine running this has
//! rust-analyzer on it, and a cold index would turn a forty-second suite into a minutes-long
//! one. So every test here switches the language-server side of the pane on and then points
//! it at a file no server has ever heard of, which is both the honest way to test the wiring
//! without a server and the state most of a repo is really in: the pane asks once, hears that
//! nothing serves the file, and everything carries on exactly as it did before there was
//! anything to ask.
//!
//! There is one exception, at the bottom, and it is marked `#[ignore]` for exactly that
//! reason: `typing_in_a_real_crate_offers_what_rust_analyzer_knows` starts rust-analyzer on a
//! throwaway cargo crate and types into it. (The ⌘-click's own real-server test lives beside
//! the review that makes it, in `crate::native::ui_tests::diff_selection`, and is ignored for
//! the same reason.) Everything above proves each half in isolation -
//! the pane's side here, the protocol's side in the `moon_lsp` crate, the popup's in the editor
//! crate - and none of it proves the whole of it works in one window, which is the only thing
//! anyone is actually shipping. So that test exists, and is run on purpose with
//! `cargo test --lib -- --ignored` rather than as part of a suite that has to stay fast.
