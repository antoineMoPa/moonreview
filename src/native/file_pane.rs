//! One file of the repo, open in a tab of its own for reading and editing.
//!
//! The text and how it is drawn belong to `egui_moon_editor`; what is here is where the text
//! came from and where it goes - fetching it through the backend, writing it back, the pane's
//! own chrome, and the rendered page a markdown file opens on. The find bar stays here too:
//! the editor takes the ranges to mark as input and says how many it laid out. A ⌘-click on a
//! name in the text is the same shape of thing: the editor says which word was clicked, and
//! [`crate::native::definition`] is what turns that into a file to open. The language server
//! behind the file is told what this pane is showing by
//! [`crate::native::lsp_document`], which holds what it has heard on the pane it belongs to,
//! and what that server offers to finish the word being typed with is
//! [`crate::native::completing`]'s business - this pane hands the list in and hands the
//! editor's answer back on.
