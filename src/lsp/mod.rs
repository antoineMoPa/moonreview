//! Language servers for the files the editor has open: where a definition is, and what can
//! be typed next.
//!
//! A server has to run where the files are. A session may be reviewing a repo on another
//! machine, so a server started in the window would be reading the wrong disk - or no disk
//! at all. So this lives repo-side, exactly as the shells in [`crate::terminal`] do: the
//! registry hangs off [`crate::api::AppState`], the window reaches it through
//! [`crate::backend::Backend`], and a `--remote` session gets the same answers over HTTP as
//! a local one gets by calling straight through.
//!
//! The client itself is [`moon_lsp`], which knows nothing about reviews: it takes a
//! [`Workspace`] - a repo root and an opaque key the servers are held under - and answers
//! about files in it. This module is the layer that turns a session into one of those, and
//! [`routes`] is the same thing again over HTTP.
